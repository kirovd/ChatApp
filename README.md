# Chat Application

## Project Overview
This project is a modern chat application designed to emulate real-time messaging in a user-friendly interface. Built using React, the app offers a unique message grouping system and an intuitive UI, making it ideal for seamless communication.

## Objectives
- To create a dynamic and responsive chat application that replicates real-world messaging experiences.
- Implement an intelligent UI to display messages based on timing and sender, enhancing readability and user engagement.
- Utilize React's robust features and maintainable code.

## How It Works
- **Message Display**: Messages are displayed in a bubble format, akin to popular messaging applications, providing a familiar look and feel.
- **Grouping Logic**:
  - Messages sent more than an hour apart are sectioned with their date and timestamp, formatted as “{day} {timestamp}”.
  - Messages from the same user sent within 20 seconds are grouped with smaller vertical spacing, creating a visual grouping of rapid conversations.
- **User Interaction**:
  - The interface allows users to send messages, which are then displayed within the chat window.
  - An implementation for receiving messages (simulated or real-time) can be customized as per the project's requirements.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Used for building the user interface, leveraging its component-based architecture for efficient rendering.
